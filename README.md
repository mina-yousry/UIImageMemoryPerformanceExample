# UIImageMemoryPerformanceExample

This repository contains a project demonstrating memory optimization techniques for image processing in iOS. Based on the techniques described in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@mena.yousry94/introduction-b5943a5da036), this example illustrates how to reduce memory usage when applying image filters by using memory-efficient methods such as `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` and managing memory regions effectively.

## Key Concepts

- **Memory Regions**: Understanding virtual memory regions in iOS using `vmmap`.
- **Optimizing Image Processing**: Reducing memory usage by choosing the right graphics renderer (`UIGraphicsImageRenderer` vs `UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions`).
- **Efficient Memory Handling**: Loading images directly from a URL without loading the entire image into memory.

## Features

- Demonstrates memory optimization techniques in an iOS app.
- Shows how to track and analyze memory usage using `vmmap` and `malloc_history`.
- Provides a practical implementation of a filter application with improved memory efficiency.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 12.0 or later
- iOS 12.0 or later

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mina-yousry/UIImageMemoryPerformanceExample.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

   ```bash
   open UIImageMemoryPerformanceExample.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.

### How to Use

1. Run the app and apply the `Noir` filter to an image.
2. Observe the reduction in memory usage by comparing the memory spikes before and after the optimization.

### Example Output

After implementing the changes outlined in the article, the memory spike is reduced by **78%**, from a high memory usage to just **70 MB**!

## Explanation of Code Changes

The main improvements include:
- Replacing `UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions` with `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` to automatically choose the best memory format.
- Using `CIImage` to create an image directly from a URL, eliminating the need to load the entire image into memory.

## Check out the final result

The final version of the project can be found in the `final-result` branch.
